peer-upnp: SAX Parsing Error on receipt of event messages
- Error: Text data outside of root node.
- Looks like badly formed xml from a renderer/server
- Modified peer-upnp.js:handlePostEvent
  Changed xml2js.parseString(req.data,{mergeAttrs: true
  to      xml2js.parseString(req.data,{strict: false, mergeAttrs: true

  This didn't work. Changed to wrap parseString in try catch
